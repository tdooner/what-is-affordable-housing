# affordable housing project

**mission statement: informational tool for voters**

- try to be unbiased r.e. facts, but might have to 

- lots of city regulations and state regulations that could be explored

**general structure**

- different kinds of "affordable housing"

- there's roughly a 5-year waiting list for places

**incentives to build for incomes \< $60,000**

- LITEC (sp?) 80% of funding comes from taxpayers for 60% of AMI

- does a "donut hole" exist where building for middle-income tenants is uneconomical?

- for low-income applicants, sometimes it's too hard to come up with a down payment and units remain unoccupied

**tenant income: making slightly too much money for your section 8 housing?**

- investigate a grace period

- Average Median Income (AMI) determines how affordable the housing is

 **TODO: **Find all the AMI brackets that are used

**757 affordable units were build in 2014**

- how much is this in relation to total housing stock

- ..in relation to previous years?

**as a real estate developer....**

- how much subsidy to tenants?

- some cities have a standard percentage of affordable housing required (SF: 15%)

 - negotiations between developer and community organizations might require more than that

 - perhaps a visualization of previous years' data would be good

- there are nonprofit housing developers. Let's find some of the biggest ones.

 - the nonprofit developer puts together financing for affordable units in a larger project

 - most are in the red and the loss gets eaten by the bank

**section 8 housing**

- Landlord still gets market rate, subsidized by the city

- "slum lords" only use it in practice because you only have an incentive to do so if your rent would be less than market rate

**Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)**

- businesses pay into a fund to operate in the area

- each housing unit might have to pay into this fund

**seattle does a great job**

- builds 3,500 units every year

- also redwood city & oakland & sunnyvale

**san francisco as a part of the bay area**

- perhaps compare and contrast different cities

- Association Bay Area Governments - "Regional Housing Needs" allocations that doesn't end up being met

**$800,000/unit**

- according to Deborah this is the average cost per-unit these days, which has implications on rent

- can we find a source for this? It seems like a great gigantic number to slap in a header on the page

**alternatives**

- rather than subsidizing rent, create a fund which helps people afford down payments on a home

- rather than giving money to new projects, give money as incentives to renovate old units
